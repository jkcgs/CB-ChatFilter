CB-ChatFilter
=============

A CraftBukkit plugin that allows to limit what players can say on general Minecraft chat.
This plugin has no relation with SableDnah's ChatFilter plugin.
I can't rename everything now. Sorry, I'm really sorry.

TODO: 
 - Feedback, please :c
 
Planned:
 - Add an info string for each toggle when toggling it (it shows the same for all of them)
 - Specific replacement string for every filter (except for IP filter)
 - Filter/block repeated chat messages
